/**
 * Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means
 * B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.
 * 
 * We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means
 * the ith element in A appears in B at index j.
 * 
 * These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers,
 * output any of them.
 * 
 * For example, given
 * 
 * A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
 * B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
 * 
 * We should return
 * [1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
 * as P[0] = 1 because the 0th element of A appears at B[1], and P[1] = 4
 * because the 1st element of A appears at B[4], and so on.
 * 
 * Note:
 * A, B have equal lengths in range [1, 100].
 * A[i], B[i] are integers in range [0, 10^5].
